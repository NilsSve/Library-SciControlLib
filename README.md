This is a specially adapted Scintilla Editor library, for the DFRefactor project/repo.

It is included in the DFRefactor repo as a submodule and will get installed automatically when cloning DFRefactor. It doesn't make sense to use it anywhere else.

This library was originally forked from here:
https://projects.vdf-guidance.com/projects/dfsplat/repository/scicontrollib

and then adapted for the DFRefactor project.
